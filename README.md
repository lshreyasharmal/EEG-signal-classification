Advisor: [Prof Richa Singh]()

Electroencephalography(EEG) is an electrophysiological monitoring method to record electrical activity of the brain. It is typically noninvasive, with the  electrodes placed along the scalp. It plays an important role in the domain of braincomputer interface (BCI). Compared with other biomedical signals, the EEG is extremely difficult for an untrained observer to understand because of the spatial mapping of functions onto different regions of the brain and electrode placement. Besides, feature extraction and pattern recognition are crucial for data processing. So, we classified the EEG patters by applying dimensionality transformation techniques like PCA. For classification we used LDA and HMM algorihms and compared various architectures to see which works the best. We have applied the self implemented versions of all the mentioned the algorithms from scratch. We also compared our results with the open-source versions of the algorithms and some other classification APIs.

The datasets on which we experimented : [Seizure vs Non-Seizure](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Epileptic+Seizure+Recognition) and [Alcoholic vs Non-Alcoholic](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/EEG+Database)
